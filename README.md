Our group of five students, who are interested in the field of life science and biostatistics, have embarked on a study of colon cancer. The impetus for our research came from a startling prediction we found on Science Daily, which suggested that colorectal cancer could become the leading cause of cancer death in individuals aged 20-49 in the U.S. by the year 2030 (ScienceDaily, 2023). This prediction has inspired us to delve into the realm of colon cancer, which is one of the most prevalent types of cancer.

Our research revealed that colon cancer has an extremely high mortality rate, with over 17,000 deaths from rectal cancer and approximately 30,000 new cases each year in the UK alone, making it the second leading cause of cancer death after lung cancer (A Leslie, 2002). This information piqued our interest in studying colon cancer and the available therapies to determine whether they can alleviate or cure colon cancer patients.

While there are already thousands of studies on colon cancer, each approaching the issue from a different angle, our focus is on examining the effectiveness of existing therapies. Our goal is to compare and validate different treatments to determine which ones can prolong the survival time of patients and provide effective treatment.

The objective of our study is to address the problem of colon cancer mortality and investigate the impact of certain factors on its treatment. Specifically, we are interested in understanding how a particular factor affects the mortality rate of colon cancer patients. To achieve this, we will be analyzing the colon dataset in R, which provides us with a wealth of information about the disease and its treatments. Our research aims to contribute to the larger body of knowledge in this field, ultimately leading to better outcomes for colon cancer patients. By focusing on the treatment of colon cancer and nodes, we hope to provide valuable insights that can be used to improve the lives of those affected by this disease.

Our study uses a commonly used dataset in survival analysis, which includes information on patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The dataset, which can be accessed directly in R, was initially collected in 1989 and updated until 1994. 

The colon cancer dataset contains 1858 observations and 16 variables, including time from surgery to death or end of the study, patient status, age, sex, obstructing tumor, perforated tumor, tumor adherence, and the number of cancerous lymph nodes. These variables include both binary and numeric data, with binary variables such as sex, obstruct, perfor, and adhere indicating the presence or absence of certain conditions. Numeric variables such as time, age, and nodes provide quantitative data. The "status" variable is a binary variable indicating whether or not the patient died during the study. (See Table 1) According to the status column in the colon dataset, there were 920 patients recorded as deceased by the end of the study, marked with a status code of 1. This translates to an event rate of 49.515%, which represents the percentage of patients who passed away during the study period.

Notably, the colon cancer dataset has a relatively low number of missing values, with only 82 observations marked as NA. However, it's worth mentioning that all missing values occur exclusively in the "nodes" and "differ" columns. While this may have a minor impact on our data analysis, we will carefully consider the potential effects of these missing values on our overall findings.(figure1)
